# NOVA ✦ Generative Art Gallery

An interactive gallery of GPU-accelerated generative art exhibits featuring WebGL shaders authored by cutting-edge AI.

**[✦ Experience NOVA Live](https://nova.nldlabs.cloud)**

## The Experiment

**What happens when you give state-of-the-art AI direct access to the GPU?**

This project explores the frontier of AI-generated graphics. Rather than constraining AI to dated frameworks that limit creative expression, NOVA provides direct access to modern graphics programming:

- **WebGL/GLSL shaders** — Real-time GPU computation at 60fps
- **Procedural generation** — Mathematical beauty through noise functions, ray marching, and vector fields
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** — Production-grade architecture

Every fragment shader in this gallery was written by AI—from simplex noise implementations to volumetric fog rendering, from flow field dynamics to nebula color grading. The shaders were iteratively refined through natural language, with the AI optimizing GPU performance, tuning visual parameters, and solving complex graphics problems in real-time.

## Features

- 🎨 **AI-Authored Shaders** — GLSL code generated and optimized by frontier AI models
- 🌌 **Volumetric Effects** — Animated fog, stars, nebula colors, and aurora lighting
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized** — Carefully tuned noise functions for smooth rendering
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** — Adaptive quality scaling for mobile GPUs
- 🎛️ **Interactive Controls** — Real-time parameter manipulation for each exhibit

## Performance & Scalability

Exhibits are balanced to run smoothly on the widest range of devices—from mobile phones to integrated graphics—while still showcasing the power of AI-generated shaders. On higher-end hardware, crank the parameters up: more particles, higher noise octaves, denser fog. The difference is dramatic.

## Exhibits

- **Flow Fields** — Particles dancing through procedural vector fields
- *More coming soon...*

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite
- WebGL2 / GLSL ES 3.0
- Framer Motion
- CSS Modules

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why This Matters

AI capabilities are bounded by the tools we provide. Constrain it to a 1995 graphics library and you get 1995 results. Give it direct GPU access and modern shader languages—and watch it create something new.
